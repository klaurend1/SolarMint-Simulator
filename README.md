# Renewable Energy Data Modeling System

A Python based simulation that converts sunlight intensity readings into digital tokens, demonstrating how renewable energy can be quantified and recorded using blockchain inspired logic.

## How It Works
- Generates random sunlight intensity values (0–1000)
- Converts each reading into tokens using the formula:
```

tokens = intensity / 100

````
- Saves all readings and token values in a CSV file named `ledger.csv`

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/klaurend1/SolarMint-Simulator.git
 cd SolarMint-Simulator
````

2. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
3. View results in the terminal and open `ledger.csv` to see recorded data.

## Example Output

```
Simulated Solar Tokenizer Starting...

[17:25:41] Intensity: 876 → Minted: 8.76 ST | Total: 8.76
[17:25:42] Intensity: 542 → Minted: 5.42 ST | Total: 14.18
Simulation complete! Data saved to ledger.csv
```

## Future Work

* Replace simulated values with real data from an Arduino solar cell.
* Connect to a blockchain for verified energy tokenization.
